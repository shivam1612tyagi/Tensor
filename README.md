## ⚙️ Techniques & Technologies

- **Vectorization**  
  Tensor leverages [vectorized operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Advanced_operations#vectorization), reducing the need for loops. This results in faster and more efficient computations.

- **Broadcasting**  
  With the power of [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html), Tensor makes it possible to perform operations on tensors of different shapes without manually reshaping them, ensuring efficient memory use and operations.

- **Matrix Multiplication**  
  Tensor implements efficient matrix multiplication algorithms, enabling faster linear algebra operations, which are crucial for training deep learning models.

- **Lazy Evaluation (Coming Soon)**  
  In future updates, Tensor will support lazy evaluation, meaning it will defer computations until they're absolutely necessary, further reducing memory overhead.
